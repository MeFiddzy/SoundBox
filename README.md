# Uploading the sounds
## Manual
To upload the sounds manualy they should be in the .wav format and be put in the Sounds directory.
## With the UI
Click the Upload files button.
# Ordering the sounds
To order the sounds you can use the character ```` ` ````. An exemple is ```` !`a ```` is before ```` !!`b ```` because the the first string is, in lexigraphic order, after the second one.
> **NOTE:**  You don't have to worry about the text to apear on the soundbox as ```` !`a ```` because anything before the ```` ` ```` character is removed.
